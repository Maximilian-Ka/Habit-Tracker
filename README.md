# Habit-Tracker
WebApp for tracking habits. Ultimately aims to be a customizable habit tracker / journal that runs on your own PC and 
represents a better option than e.g., One Note or classic pen & paper notes.

Optionally: If it solves the problems it is made to solve well, a mobile version could be an option.
